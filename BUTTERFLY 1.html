    Tell me I’ve been lied to <br>
    Crying isn't like you, ooh<br>
    What the hell did I do?<br>
    Never been the type to<br>

    Let someone see right through, ooh<br>
    Maybe won't you take it back?<br>
    Say you were tryna make me laugh<br>
    And nothing has to change today<br>
    You didn’t mean to say: I love you<br>

    I love you<br>
    And I don't want to, ooh<br>
    Up all night<br>
    On another red-eye<br>
    We wish we never learned to fly high<br>

    Maybe we should just try<br>
    To tell ourselves a good lie<br>
    Didn't mean to make you cry, I<br>
    Maybe won't you take it back?<br>
    Say you were tryna make me laugh<br>
    And nothing has to change today<br>
    You didn't mean to say: I love you<br>

    love you<br>
    And I don't want to, ooh<br>
    The smile that you gave me<br>
    Even when you felt like dying<br>
    fall apart as it gets dark<br>

    I'm in your arms in Central Park<br>
    There's nothing you could do or say<br>
    I can’t escape the way I love you<br>
    I don’t want to<br>
    But I love you, ooh<br>
    Ooh, ooh<br>
    Ooh, ooh<br> </p>
